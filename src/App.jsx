/*
  Tasks:
    - create a search component
    - add code to display only the houses based on the search
      result.
    - add instantiation of Search component in App.jsx
  Previous Task:
     - Create HouseList component
     - see discussion about React state in HouseList component.

  Previous Task:
  Setup: 
    npm install bootstrap
    Once the installation is complete, we can include it in our appâ€™s 
    entry file in main.jsx :
    --  Bootstrap CSS
    import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";
    -- Bootstrap Bundle JS
    import "bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min";

    Now since we created the project with Vite, we can rely 
    on Vite's plugins to integrate ESLint properly. Run the 
    following command
       npm install vite-plugin-eslint --save-dev
